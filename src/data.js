        name: 'La Mer Dubai, UAE: A Fascinating Dining, Shopping & Entertainment Destination',
        content: 'La Mer (meaning "The Sea" in French; Al Bahr البحر in Arabic) in Jumeira, Dubai. It is an outdoor mall with a beachfront that offers shopping, dining, and fun-filled leisure attractions. The place is huge spreading across 800,000 square meters of land when fully developed with a water park scheduled to open in 2018. La Mer was opened in late 2017 and since then has attracted thousands of locals, expats, and tourists to visit the place for dining, shopping, leisure, and entertainment. Parking spaces, including an underground parking, can accommodate more than a thousand vehicles. Weekends are busy days with so many people so that parking and dealing with the traffic going in and out may be a bit challenging. During our visit, on a Friday, we were able to have a walkthrough of the North and Central locations. The South location will have to be next time since we arrived past 5 pm. With the many attractions and because the place was huge, we were not able to cover all of La Mer. Enjoy watching the video. Thanks.',
